<p>You can get started with using flexCarousel.js by downloading the required files from the <a href="{{ site.github }}">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>The only dependency that flexCarousel.js has, is jQuery which you need to load before the plugin. After you have loaded both jQuery and flexCarousel.js, you need to initialize the plugin.</p>
<p>You can also use the slim version of jQuery if preferred.</p>
<p>This is what your HTML structure should look like:</p>
{% highlight html %}<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="flexCarousel.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="my-class">
      <div>1</div>
      <div>2</div>
      <div>3</div>
      <div>4</div>
      <div>5</div>
    </div>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="flexCarousel.js"></script>
    <script>
      $(document).ready(function() {
        $('.my-class').flexCarousel();
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
